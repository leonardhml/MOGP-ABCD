function varargout = ainit(varargin)

%AINIT Initialize audi variable.
%   x = AINIT(v) is an audi variable with value v and derivative 1 
%   to be used as argument of univariate functions, as in y = f(x). 
%   v is a double array of arbitrary dimension.
%
%   x = AINIT(v,k) is an audi variable with derivatives up to order k, 
%   where all derivatives of order 2 or higher are set to 0. 
%
%   [x1,...,xn] = AINIT(v1,...,vn,[k=1]) is a set of audi variables to
%   be used as arguments of functions depending on n variables, as in 
%   y = f(x1,...,xn).
%
%   x = AINIT(v,n,d,k) is an audi variable of dimension n and order k which
%   is all zero, except for x{d} = v.
