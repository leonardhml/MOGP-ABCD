% Version 2.1 - October 30, 2016
%
% The *AutoDiff toolbox* realizes automatic differentiation of functions
% by means of operator overloading. Without relying on the symbolic toolbox,
% it provides 
%
% * Ordinary and partial derivatives of arbitrary order
% * Differential operators, like Laplacian and curl
% * Creation of stand-alone functions, as requested for optimization or ODE tools
% * Taylor expansions of explicit expressions and solutions of ODEs
% * Curvature computation for curves and surfaces
% * Resolution of singularities of type "0/0" by l'Hospital's rule
%
% Automatic differentiation is useful whenever derivatives of
% functional expressions are needed and calculus by hand is too tedious. 
% Finite differences and symbolic computations are alternatives with
% pros and cons known to anybody working with them.
%
% The _audi_ class, which is the central part of the toolbox, admits to 
% evaluate derivatives of functions which
% are defined in the usual way by composing arithmetic operators and
% elementary functions. During evaluation, derivatives are computed in 
% the background without further user interaction if the input variables 
% are of class _audi_. In principle, automatic differentiation yields 
% exact results, but of course, accuracy is subject to rounding errors, 
% as for any other numerical computation.
%
% Besides some minor modifications and bug fixes, this release of *AutoDiff* 
% addresses several issues raised by users in the forum. Thanks to you all 
% for your comments!

%% Initialization and evaluation
% When initializing arguments of functions as _audi_ variables, subsequent
% results of computations do not only contain functions values, as usual,
% but also derivatives up to some given order |k|. 
%
% *Univariate case:* 
% Let |f| be a function depending on one variable.
% To evaluate |f| and all its derivatives up to order |k|
% at some points |v|, stored as a _double_ array, type
%
%       x = ainit(v,k)
%       y = f(x)
%
% Curly braces are used to get the values |yd| of the |d|-th derivative
% of |f| at the points |v|:
%
%       yd = y{d}
%
% The size of the double array |yd| is
%
%       asize(y) = size(yd) = size(v)

%%

% Example
x = ainit(1:5,3);      % initialize audi variable, up to 3rd derivative covered
y = x.^3;              % compute function f(x) = x^3
y{2}                   % values of 2nd derivative, f''(x) = 6x

%%
% *Multivariate case:* If |f| depends on |n| variables and shall be evaluated
% at the some points |v1,...,vn|, stored as _double_ arrays of equal size, type
%
%      [x1,...,xn] = ainit(v1,...,vn,k)
%      y = f(x1,...,xn)
%
% Again, curly braces are used to get the values |yd| of the partial derivative of order
% |d1,...,dn| at the points |v1,...,vn|:
%
%       yd = y{d1,...,dn}
%
% The sum |d1+...+dn| must not exceed
%
%       aord(y) = k
%
% Curly braces can be replaced by the command |aeval|,
%
%       y{d1,...,dn} = aeval(y,d1,...,dn)
%
% _Example:_ 
% <example1.html Functions, derivatives, and Newton's method>

% <matlab:doc('aord') aord>

%% Arrays
% _audi_ variables can be concatenated to form arrays in the familiar way.
% When combining _audi_ variables and _doubles_, the latter are treated as
% constants.
% Also operations like |repmat| or |transpose| are supported. _audi_ arrays
% can be multiplied by other arrays of class _double_ or _audi_ in the sense
% of matrix and elementwise multiplication using the operators |*| and |.*|,
% respectively.
%
% Parentheses select subarrays of _audi_ arrays. By contrast, to define the 
% _audi_ array |b| which contains only parts of the data of the given 
% _audi_ array |a|, use
%
%       b = aget(a,ref)  
%
% where |ref| is a single index or a list of indices addressing parts 
% of the data arrays. Note that |size(b)=size(a)|, while |asize(b)| and
% |asize(a)| may be different.
% Parts of _audi_ data are replaced by
%
%       a = aset(a,b,ref) 
%
% Evaluation of arrays by curly braces follows special formatting rules, as
% documented for |aeval|.
%
% _Example:_ 
% <example2.html Curvature and torsion of a space curve> 
%

%% Taylor expansion of explicit functions and ODEs
% *Explicit case:* Let |f| be a scalar function of one variable. To determine
% the coefficients |p| of the Taylor polynomial of degree |k| at the point |x0|, 
% type
%
%       x = ainit(x0,k)
%       p = ataylor(f(x))

%%

% Example
x = ainit(1,4);
p = ataylor(log(x))

%%
% *Solution of ODE:* Consider the initial value problem
%
%       y'(x) = f(x,y)
%       y(x0) = y0
%
% To obtain the coefficients |p| of the degree |k| Taylor polynomial of the sought
% function |y| at |x0|, type
%
%       p = aode(f,x0,y0,k)
%
% where |f = @(x,y)...| is an anonymous function. For systems of ODEs,
% the Taylor polynomials |p1,...,pm| of the sought functions |y1,...,ym|
% can be computed by
%
%       [p1,...,pm] = aode(f,x0,y0,k)
%
% where |f = @(x,y1,...,ym)[...;...;...]| is an anonymous function returning
% a column vector with |m| entries.
%
% It is possible to pass additional parameters to the routine,
%
%       [p1,...,pm] = aode(f,x0,y0,k,c1,c2,...)
%
% _Example:_ 
% <example3.html The mathematical pendulum> 
%
% _See also:_ 
% <matlab:doc('ataylor') ataylor>,
% <matlab:doc('aode') aode>

%% Differential operators
%
% Differential operators map _audi_ variables to new _audi_ variables of lower order.
% 
% The general differentiation operator is
%
%       yd = adiff(y,d1,...,dn)
%
% The order of the _audi_ variable |yd| is
%
%       aord(yd) = aord(y) - (d1+...+dn)
%
% The _audi_ class also provides various other predefined differential operators:
%
% * scalar-valued: |alap| (Laplacian), |adiv| (divergence)
% * vector-valued: |agrad| (gradient), |acurl| (curl)
% * matrix-valued: |ajac| (Jacobian), |ahess| (Hessian)
% 
% There exists a shortcut to evaluate the outcome of any of these operators:
%
%      a*(y,0) = aeval(a*(y),0,...,0)
% 
% 
% _Example:_ 
% <example4.html  Laplacian of the peaks function and its maximum> 
%
% _See also:_ 
% <matlab:doc('acurl') acurl>,
% <matlab:doc('adiff') adiff>,
% <matlab:doc('adiv') adiv>,
% <matlab:doc('agrad') agrad>,
% <matlab:doc('ahess') ahess>,
% <matlab:doc('ajac') ajac>,
% <matlab:doc('alap') alap>

%% Stand-alone functions
%
% Sometimes, it is convenient or even necessary to have available a stand-alone 
% function for evaluating gradients or other differential properties of a given 
% function. In particular, if you want to 
%
% * pass derivatives to routines like |integral| or |fzero|
% * enhance the performance of optimization routines like |fmincon| by supplying
%   gradients or Hessians
% * furnish solvers for stiff ODEs like |ode15s| by supplying Jacobians 
%
% such functionality is requested. To this end, all differential operators described 
% in the preceding section are able to create function handles from function handles. 
% Using this feature, initialization of _audi_ variables becomes obsolete at the
% cost of slightly increased computation times.

%%

% Example
f_uvv = adiff(@peaks,[1 2]);    % 2nd argument = order of differentiation
f_uvv(-2:2,zeros(1,5))          % evaluate partial derivative

L = alap(@peaks,2);             % 2nd argument = number of variables
L(-2:2,zeros(1,5))              % evaluate Laplacian

%%
% It is important to note that the arguments to the functions |f_uvv| and |L|
% are standard double arrays, and not _audi_ variables.

%%
% When solving a stiff ODE |y' = f(t,y),| the Jacobian |J| of |f| with respect to
% |y| may be supplied to solvers like |ode15s| to enhance performance. The
% according function handle can be created as follows:
%
%       g = @(t,y1,...,yn) f(t,[y1;...;yn]);   % function with scalar arguments
%       j = ajac(g,[0 1...1]);                 % Jacobian, 1st argument is parameter
%       J = @(t,y) j(t,y(1),...,y(n));         % Jacobian with vector argument
%
% According constructions apply for constrained and unconstrained optimization.

%% Rule of l'Hospital
%
% Singularities of type |"0/0"| are resolved automatically using the 
% rule of l'Hospital as long as the order of the singularity does not 
% exceed the order of the _audi_ variable. Information on higher order 
% derivatives can get lost and is then replaced by |NaN|.
%
% _Example:_ 
% <example5.html Sinc function and rule of l'Hospital> 
%
% See also: 
% <matlab:doc('ataylor') ataylor>

%% Matrix computations
%
% The _audi_ class provides some basic functionality for matrix computations.
% All binary operators are implemented as well as the commands 
% |det,trace,sum,diff,inv,| and |norm|. However, not all commands support all
% features of the built-in commands. For instance, it is not possible to
% solve underdetermined systems by the backslash operator.  
%
% _Example:_ 
% <example6.html Gaussian and mean curvature of a Klein bottle> 

%% Curves and Surfaces
%
% Differential geometric properties of parametrized curves and surfaces can 
% be computed conveniently using the programs |acurve| and |asurf|, respectively.
%
% Curvature as well as tangent and normal vector of a planar curve |C| are given by
%
%      [kap,T,N] = acurve(C)
%
% If |C| is a space curve, also torsion and the binormal vector are provided,
%
%      [kap,tau,T,N,B] = acurve(C)
%
% For a surface |S|, the Gaussian and mean curvature, the normal vector, and the
% first two fundamental forms are computed by
%
%      [K,H,N,G,B] = asurf(S)
%
% _Example:_ 
% <example7.html Curvature revisited> 
%
% See also: 
% <matlab:doc('acurve') acurve>,
% <matlab:doc('asurf') asurf>

%% Overloaded operators and functions
% The _audi_ class overloads
%
% * all unary and binary arithmetic operators
% * all relational and logical operators (except for |&&| and | || |)
% * the elementary functions |exp,sin,cos,tan,sinh,cosh,tanh| and their inverses
% * the functions |det,trace,inv,norm,sum,diff,sqrt,|
%   |abs,min,max,cross,dot,real,imag,conj,angle,sign,|
%   |isreal,isfinite,polyval,fft,ifft,bsxfun|
%
% To overload any other function |fct| defined for doubles, insert the lines
%
%       function y = fct(x)
%         df = @(x) ...;
%         y  = adval(df,x);
%       end
%
% in the |methods| section of the class definition |audi.m|. The anonymous 
% function |df| must return the derivative of |fct| at |x|. 
%
% If |fct| depends on additional parameters, say |fct(a,b,x,c)|, then use the syntax
%
%       function y = fct(a,b,x,c)
%         df = @(a,b,x,c) ...;
%         y  = adval(df,a,b,x,c,3);
%       end
%
% to indicate that |df| is the partial derivative of |fct| with respect
% to the third argument.
%
% _Example:_ 
% See the methods |sin| and |polyval| in the class definition |audi.m|.


%% Limitations
%
% * The set of overloaded methods is not complete, but should
%   cover a substantial class of applications. Additional functions are readily 
%   overloaded when needed.
% * The implementation aims at generality and ease of use at the cost of a
%   certain slow-down, in particular when requesting high order derivatives
%   for functions with many unknowns.
% * Currently, there is no mechanism to overload built-in functions depending
%   on several variables, like |ellipj|. In such cases, one argument can be
%   selected as variable, while all others are treated as parameters.
% * Function input is rarely checked for validity. So error messages
%   may be confusing when evoked by subordinate functions.
% * Matrix computations like |inv| or |det| are slow for bigger matrices.
% * Matrix factorization routines, like |qr| or |eig| are not supported, yet.
