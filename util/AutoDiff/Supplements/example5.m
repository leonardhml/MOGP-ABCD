% Note that the second derivative at 0 is not plottet because 
% the order of x is 2 so that the second derivative cannot be
% determined there. Generally, when initializing x with order k,
% then derivatives up to order k-r are available, where r is
% the number of times you have to apply l'Hospital's rule until
% it yields a finite result.

% Accordingly, the order of the Taylor polynomial is reduced.
