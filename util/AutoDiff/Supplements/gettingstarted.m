%% Getting Started
%
% After initializing a variable of class _audi_ by the command |ainit|, 
% subsequent computations yield not only function values, but also derivatives. 
% Curly braces are used for evaluation. 

%%
% Consider the function
f = @(x) cos(2*x-1)/x;

%%
% Then
x = ainit(0.5);
y = f(x);
[y{0} y{1}]

%% 
% shows that |f(0.5) = 2| and |f'(0.5) = -4|.
% Derivatives of higher order are available after according initialization:

%%
x = ainit(0.5,3);
y = f(x);
[y{0} y{1} y{2} y{3}]

%%
% The cubic Taylor polynomial of |f| centered at the point |x=0.5| is
ataylor(y)

%%
% Tou can also initialize _audi_ variables with array data and 
% deal with multivariate functions:

%%
x = ainit(linspace(0,8),2);
y = f(x);
figure(1), plot(x{0},[y{0};y{1};y{2}])
axis([0 8 -2 3]), grid on

[u,v] = ndgrid(linspace(-2,2,40));
[u,v] = ainit(u,v,2);
p = peaks(u,v);
