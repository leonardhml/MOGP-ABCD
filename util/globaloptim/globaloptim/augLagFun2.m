% The remaining code is executed only in the vectorized case.
% Assumption about points:
% Case 1:
% ROW major points (every row is a point); also applies to one dimensional
% problems
%
% If X0 = [5 -9 ....3]  Size: 1-by-N  then points is supposed to have the form:
%
% point = [5 -9 ....3
%          9  1 ....3
%          ...
%          ....
%          -8  2 ...10]  Size: M-by-N
% When the objective function is called with points we expect a vector 
% F of length M (row or column).
% When the constraint function is called with points we expect a matrix
% cin and ceq of size M-by-I and M-by-E respectively. 
%

% row major points: every row is a point
% equality test cover single dimension problems; we require that the
% vectorized points be a row major
row_major = col >= row && row == 1;

% Case 2
% COL major points (every col is a point)
% 
% X0 = [5 
%      -9
%       .
%       .
%       .
%       3]  Size: N-by-1
% 
% A vectorized points of M points would look like:
% 
% Points = [5  7   .  .  . 4
%       -9  1   .  .  . 3
%        .   .    .  .  .  .
%        .   .    .  .  .  .
%        3  2   .  .  .  0]  Size: N-by-M
% 
% Number of inequality constraints: I
% Number of equality constraints: E
% 
% When the objective function is called with points we expect a vector 
% F of length M (row or column vector).
% When the constraint function is called with points we expect a matrix 
% cin and ceq of size I-by-M and E-by-M respectively.
