%GSSDIRECTIONS2 finds search2 vectors when linear constraints and bounds are
% present by explicitly calculating the Tangent Cone (of inequality 
% constraints) in the Null Space of the linear equality constraints. 
% 'MeshSize' is the current step size and 'XCurrent' is the current point. 
% 'Aineq','bineq','Aeq','lb', and 'ub' are linear and bound constraint 
%  information. 
% 'NullBasisAeq' is a set of basis vectors that spans the Null Space of the
%  linear equality constraints in 'Aeq'.
% 'epsBall' is the binding tolerance used for determining whether constraints
%  are active or not.  
% 'Basis' is the set of core search2 directions spanning the unconstrained space
% 'TangentCone' is the set of core search2 directions spanning the 
%  space of linear inequality constraints
% 'AugmentedDirs' contains additional search2 directions besides the ones
% contained in 'Basis' and 'TangentCone'. These are not required to ensure 
% convergence but might speed up the search2 process.
